API Runtime Behavior

The API is implemented using FastAPI and exposes endpoints for semantic retrieval and
full RAG-based question answering.

Each incoming HTTP request is assigned a unique request ID. This request ID is stored
on the request context and returned to the client in the response headers. Request IDs
are used to correlate logs and error responses during debugging.

Error Handling

The API includes basic error handling to ensure that failures do not crash the service.
If an unexpected error occurs during request processing, the API returns a 500 Internal
Server Error response.

Upstream Service Errors

The API depends on external services such as OpenAI and Pinecone for embedding generation
and vector retrieval. Failures in these upstream services may result in request errors.
These errors are treated as internal failures and return a 500 Internal Server Error
response to the client.

Errors are logged on the server, but stack traces and internal implementation details
are not exposed to the client.

Health Check

The API exposes a /health endpoint that returns a simple status message indicating whether
the service is running.
